<p> <h2><strong>ingredians</strong></h2></p>
<ul>
    <li> <h4>Chicken breasts </h4></li>
 use boneless skinless chicken breasts, then slice each breast in half length-wise to create 
      two cutlets. Or you can use pre-cut breasts, also known as chicken cutlets.
<li><h4>flour</h4></li>
use all-purpose flour or white whole wheat for dredging the chicken in. This is used to brown the chicken.
<li><h4>Eggs</h4></li>
      an egg mixture is used to help the breadcrumbs stick to the chicken after coating it in flour.
Breadcrumbs 
– <li><h4>for the breading mixture</h4></li >
 you can use store-bought panko breadcrumbs or homemade breadcrumbs.
<li><h4>Marinara</h4></li> –
you can use a quality store-bought marinara sauce or make a homemade sauce! See below for my top recommendations.
<li><h4>Olive oil</h4></li>
 – oil is used in the pan-fried method to brown the chicken in batches. 
If you instead bake the chicken, you’ll only need a little oil.
<li><h4>Parmesan cheese</h4></li> –
 is used to add salty richness to the breadcrumbs and for sprinkling over the chicken at the end!
Fresh mozzarella cheese – used for layering over the chicken for baking. You can use shredded or sliced pieces of mozzarella.
<li><h4>Dried Italian herbs</h4></li>
 – I like to season my own breadcrumbs using a dried Italian herb blend.
Garlic powder – used for flavoring the breadcrumb mixture.
Black pepper & salt – for flavor.
Fresh basil – for sprinkling over top of the finished chicken parmesan!
</ul>
